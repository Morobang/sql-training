# Additional Advanced Topics

This folder contains **deep-dive lessons** from the original SQL training materials covering advanced database concepts, performance tuning, and modern SQL applications.

## Structure

These lessons provide granular, detailed coverage that complements the main advanced curriculum (lessons 01-12). Each folder contains multiple sub-lessons with:
- **Comprehensive theory** and best practices
- **Real-world examples** and scenarios
- **Performance considerations**
- **Advanced techniques** and patterns

## Contents

| Folder | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `01-transactions-deep-dive` | Transactions | Multiuser databases, locking mechanisms, granularities, transaction management |
| `02-indexes-constraints-deep-dive` | Indexes & Constraints | Index types, creation strategies, performance trade-offs, constraint usage |
| `03-views-deep-dive` | Views | View creation, security, data aggregation, complexity hiding |
| `04-metadata` | Metadata | Information schema, working with metadata, schema generation, deployment |
| `05-analytic-functions-deep-dive` | Analytic Functions | Window functions, data windows, localized sorting, ranking in depth |
| `06-large-databases` | Large Databases | Partitioning concepts, table/index partitioning, partitioning methods and benefits |
| `07-sql-big-data` | SQL & Big Data | Apache Drill, querying files, MongoDB, MySQL, multiple data sources |

## How to Use

### For Mastery
1. ✅ Complete **main advanced lessons 01-12** first
2. 📖 Study corresponding deep-dive folders for topics you use frequently
3. 🔬 Experiment with advanced techniques in your own projects

### For Reference
- Consult when implementing complex features (e.g., partitioning strategies)
- Review before performance tuning sessions
- Use as a guide for metadata-driven applications

### For Specialization
- **DBAs**: Focus on transactions, indexes, metadata, large databases
- **Data Engineers**: Focus on big data, partitioning, analytic functions
- **Developers**: Focus on views, transactions, constraints
