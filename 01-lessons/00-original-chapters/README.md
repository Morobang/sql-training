# Original Chapters Archive

**Status**: ✅ **All Content Migrated**

This folder served as a temporary archive during reorganization. All original chapter content has been moved to the appropriate learning levels as supplementary "deep-dive" materials.

---

## Why the Reorganization?

The new structure provides:
- **Clear progression**: Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
- **Video-timeline alignment**: Each lesson mapped to specific timestamps
- **Topic consolidation**: Related concepts grouped together
- **Practical focus**: Skills-based learning at each level
