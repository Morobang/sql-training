## 💡 Study Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Practice Daily** - Even 30 minutes a day is better than cramming
2. **Type Every Query** - Don't copy-paste; muscle memory matters
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples to see what happens
4. **Use Test Data** - Practice on sample databases, not production!
5. **Read Execution Plans** - Understand how queries actually run
6. **Document Your Learning** - Keep a notebook or blog

### Effective Learning Strategies

- **Pomodoro Technique:** 25 min study + 5 min break
- **Active Recall:** Try to write queries from memory
- **Spaced Repetition:** Review older topics regularly
- **Teach Others:** Explain concepts to solidify understanding
- **Build Projects:** Apply skills to real-world scenarios

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Skipping foundational concepts
- ❌ Not practicing regularly
- ❌ Copy-pasting without understanding
- ❌ Ignoring error messages
- ❌ Not learning to read execution plans
- ❌ Forgetting to back up databases
